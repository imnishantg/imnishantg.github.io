			<h3>MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES FOUNDATION (MSF)</h3>
			<p>RESEARCH | JUNE 2010</p>
		</header>
		<p>I did research under Group Energy, under which we:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Solar Updraft Tower:</b> Designed and assembled the prototype, analyzed its performance and studied its commercial application
			  <ul>
				<li>Improvements introduced throughout experimentation resulted in 80% increase in performance and results</li>
			  </ul>
			</li>
			<li><b>Dye Synthesized Solar Cells (Gratzel’s Cell):</b> Fabricated the cell, studied advantages and application vis-à-vis regular solar cells
				<ul>
				  <li>Were able to assembled Cells which increased generation by 200% from 0.1V/cm<sup>2</sup> to 0.3V/cm<sup>2</sup></li>
				</ul>
			  </li>
			  <li>Designed and built a working model of <b>Foot Step Electric Converter</b>, which converts impacts from footfalls into electrical energy</li>
			  <li>Prepared study material (Flash animation videos and exercises) based on 10<sup>th</sup> Class Mathematics curriculum</li>
		  </ul>

	<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/msf.jpg" alt="" /></span>The Mathematical Sciences Foundation (MSF) is a registered non-profit educational society. It has been engaged for several years in path-breaking and innovative programmes related to the teaching, understanding, learning and application of mathematics at the school, college and post-graduate levels.</p>
	<p>The Foundation organized 'Inviting All Young Minds (IAYM) - 2010' during the month of June 2010, in order to stimulate creativity through ‘hands on’ applications of mathematics with the help of computing techniques and to encourage teamwork, communication and computational skills and out of the box thinking through real world applications.</p>
