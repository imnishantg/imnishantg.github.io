		<h3>BTech Project | Simulation of Indoor OWC System</h3>
		<p>MAY 2012</p>
		<p>Dr. Parul Garg, Asst. Prof, ECE, NSIT</p>
	</header>
	<p>Simulation of Fully Customizable Duplex, High Data Rate Indoor Optical Wireless Communication System.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>It includes Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) and Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) techniques to enhance the system's Data Rate</li>
		<li>Intention is to demonstrate the possibility of using LEDs for lighting and communication purpose, simultaneously and the viability of the system</li>
		<li>TOOLS: MATLAB (Including Communication Toolbox, Symbolic Toolbox, etc.), Simulink</li>
	</ul>

		<h3>Intelligent Traffic Light Controller</h3>
		<p>MAY 2011</p>
		<p>Asst. Prof D V Gadre, ECE, NSIT</p>
	</header>
	<p>An 8085 Microprocessor Based Project. Designed and built up the PCB. Programming was done in Assembly Language</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Control the Traffic Lights according to changes in traffic situations at different time of the day</li>
		<li>It is a low cost alternative to the image processing solution, and hence can be deployed economically</li>
	</ul>

		<h3>Simulation of Hill’s Problem</h3>
		<p>DECEMBER 2010</p>
		<p>Dr. Harish Parthasarathy, Professor, ECE, NSIT</p>
	</header>
	<p>Investigated orbits for Sun Earth Moon system, as circular-restricted three-body problem (CRTBP). The trajectory was simulated in MATLAB (using symbolic toolbox), through study of nonlinear second order differential equations</p>

		<h3>Dual Power Supply</h3>
		<p>NOVEMBER 2010</p>
		<p>Asst. Prof D V Gadre, ECE, NSIT</p>
	</header>
	<p>Assembled 3.3V/5V Dual voltage power supply with maximum current of 1A with foldback limiting current of 0.5A, using LM723 Voltage Regulator from a source of 220V, 50Hz. Current  limiting  and  foldback  limiting  are  used  to limit transistor operating temperatures and prevent circuit damage</p>

		<h3>Conway’s Game Of Life</h3>
		<p>APRIL 2010</p>
	</header>
	<p>Implemented ‘John Conway’s Game of Life’ on NOKIA 3310 LCD screen, interfaced with ATmega8 micro controller</p>
	<p>The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.</p>
